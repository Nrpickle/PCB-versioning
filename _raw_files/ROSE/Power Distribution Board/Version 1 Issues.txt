__ Silkscreen __




__ Functional __
Check J15 with external resource
Add testing input ports
Add reverse voltage protection?
Oscillator test point
Recompute values for voltage detection Op Amp
Implement USB Hub (296-43109-1-ND)


__ Component Selection __ 
C8 not on BOM
C9 not on BOM
R11, R12 not on BOM
C13 not on BOM

__ Inventory __


__ Documentation __
Molex connector pinout needs to be fixed on internal documentation (they are currently reversed)

____ FIXED ____

__Silkscreen__
Make J27 more clear
No versioning marks
C13 label is obscured
Label aux6 and aux7 servo ports as 5v
R15 label is obscured
J20 and C12 labels conflict
C17 label is obscured
Receiver is misspelt
C4 is poorly labeled
LED Orientation dots need to be bigger (pcbway didn't print some of them)
Red LED is oriented opposite of green ones
Fix Oscillator footprint to comply with AVR186 (done as much as I'm going to)
Add FTDI breakout points (compatable with solderable in readers)
Orientation marks for Molex Connectors (2 and 3 pin)

__Functional__
Make large, multimeter gnd test point
Add DIP setting switch
Remove Q1
Vias touch the Crystal's case
Add fusing for rear aux power (REAR_BATT_POWER), we blew a fuse
Relay pinout is incorrect (activate the diode with the uC)
J27's polarity is reversed
Add solder to 27 large mounting holes
U8 pinout too large (about 2x)
J15's pads were placed on the wrong side of the board (meaning they're reversed)
Voltage Sense system needs to change [need to accurately sense difference between 10 and 13 volts]
FTDI Missing GND on pin 7

__Inventory__
R16 not on BOM
U5 not on BOM
Order more current sensors
