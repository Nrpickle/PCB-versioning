Labels for XTend TX/RX
Label for USB Hub Power Supply
Label for RPi power molex connector


_functional_
Remove 2.5v ADC reference voltage's dependence from the 5v rail
Remove ADC protection (refactor?)
Replace U8
Connect a precision reference voltage (e.g. 10v through a resisitor divider into the ADC void SendStringPC(const char stufftosend[]))
Connect multiple, if possible?
Make D14 level with the other LEDs
Vin of 20v switching regulator needs to be connected
