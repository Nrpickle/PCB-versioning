_silkscreen_
uUSB Port label needs to be moved slightly higher [Are these even needed?]
Serial Number label
Label OpAmp resistors with a dot for ease of soldering

_functional_
Route power through larger pads on the Rear Battery Fuse
Reset pin on FTDI chip should not be tied low
Ensure USB Connector pinout is correct (PDBv2.1 was flipped)
Switching trace for 20v supply needs to be HIGH POWER
Replace separate FTDI chips with double
Build in protection for the ADC so it can't receive 20v (diodes!)
Add 5v rail to voltage sense OpAmp
Add test points for: Temperature sensor, single current IC sense line
Add smoothing capacitor on temperature sensor (<=1uF)
Add auxiliary connection for RasPi 5v/Power the RasPi using Molex Connector instead of USB
Current going from FTDI device to rest of circuit? [This really won't be an issue, though, because the whole system will be on always]
Add vertical USB connector: reference Solidworks model of mounting plate for placement
Replace 330uF capacitor with through hole.
The OpAmp measuring the rear voltage needs a gnd reference to the rear battery
- Need to add a case if the rear battery isn't plugged in (as often happens), this could be a pull down resistor

_component selection_
C8 not on BOM'
C9 not on BOM
Replace3 TMP36 with smaller range TMP37 (20mV per deg C compared to 10mV per deg C) [This actually does not require any changes to the circuit]

_inventory_
Need more C4's
Need more C8's (a lot)


Reminders:

Unshelve polygons
20v switching regulator needs to be GROUNDED, dumbass
