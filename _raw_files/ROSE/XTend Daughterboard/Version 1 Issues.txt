__Functional__

If barrel jack holes are not drilled, then V+ does not connect to Vin

___Fixed___
XTend Footprint incorrect
DF13 holes too small (should be .5 mm)
LED Footprint wrong
If using barebones, increase ground plane clearance, for ease of soldering
Barebones - Barrel Jack holes not drilled
Inductor pads too close together (check that moving apart doesn't expose ground plane to pads, maybe only an outward widening of pads is required) #Note, these are actually perfect, they just are meant to reflow. I widened the pads to enable hand-soldering
