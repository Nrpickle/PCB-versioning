No serial number spot on silkscreen
No MODBUS ID number spot on silkscreen


__ Functional __

Used CAN tx/rx instead of hardware UART
Connections from FTDI to RS485 transceiver wrong, need to short DE / RE pins together, then this connection goes to FTDI enable. PWREN for the RS485 converted is wrong naming and doesnâ€™t reflect its purpose. No connection to PWREN on 4232 needed...
Likely that this should use a high-speed USB hub instead of the current full-speed implementation. It is easy, without deliberate planning, to hit the bottleneck of the USB hub.
No invert needed for S.BUS connection (bridge pins)
Missing 3v3 rail connection to VBAT pin on Teensy. Will program without it, but will not boot without it.
Remove GND connection for RS485 going out of the board (to ensure reverse protection downstream)

__ Component Selection __ 

For R46 vs R47 selection, only R47 is needed.
