This github repo parses my internal shorthand for recording issues with my PCBs and generates markdown to make it "pretty". Reference [www.nickmccomb.net/pcb](http://www.nickmccomb.net/pcb) for more documentation on the PCBs themselves. 

 Note that the "fixed" notation used in these messages refers to something being fixed in the next version, and is moved to that category when the next version is being designed.

## Drawer Sensing PCB
<a name="69055"></span>
### Version 1

#### Functional
- J2 pinout incorrect (needs to be swizzled)

------------- 
## Iris
<a name="64999"></span>
### Version 1

#### Silkscreen 
- No serial number spot on silkscreen
- No modbus id number spot on silkscreen

#### Functional 
- Used can tx/rx instead of hardware uart
- Connections from ftdi to rs485 transceiver wrong, need to short de / re pins together, then this connection goes to ftdi enable. pwren for the rs485 converted is wrong naming and doesnâ€™t reflect its purpose. no connection to pwren on 4232 needed...
- Likely that this should use a high-speed usb hub instead of the current full-speed implementation. it is easy, without deliberate planning, to hit the bottleneck of the usb hub.
- No invert needed for s.bus connection (bridge pins)
- Missing 3v3 rail connection to vbat pin on teensy. will program without it, but will not boot without it.
- Remove gnd connection for rs485 going out of the board (to ensure reverse protection downstream)

#### Component selection 
- For r46 vs r47 selection, only r47 is needed.

#### Inventory

## Motor Node
<a name="57148"></span>
### Version 1

#### Silkscreen 

#### Functional 
- Missing 3v3 rail connection to vbat on teensy. will program without it, but will not boot without it. connect vbat (pin 21) to the 3v3 side of c12 (closest to the xtal)
- Mcu mistakenly connected to the 5vsys, needs to be connected to the 3v3 net (as there is no 5v net on this board)
- Rgb led missing 3v3 anode connection. currently connected to non-present 5vsys net.

#### Component selection 
- Switching regulator that was purchased is not compatible with the design. a pin-compatible new one was specc'd and ordered, it is included in the bom as "alternative" parts. only u1, l1, c2, and r1 are changed. an 1n4148 diode also needs to be added per lt1933's datasheet. see schematic: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osuroboticsclub/rover20172018/master/electrical/documents/nodes/files/motorv1bodge1.jpg

#### Functional 

#### Component selection 

#### Inventory 

#### Documentation 

### Fixed 

#### Silkscreen

- Serial number label
- Label opamp resistors with a dot for ease of soldering

#### Functional
- Route power through larger pads on the rear battery fuse
- Reset pin on ftdi chip should not be tied low
- Ensure usb connector pinout is correct (pdbv2.1 was flipped)
- Switching trace for 20v supply needs to be high power
- Replace separate ftdi chips with double
- Build in protection for the adc so it can't receive 20v (diodes!)
- Add 5v rail to voltage sense opamp

- Add vertical usb connector: reference solidworks model of mounting plate for placement
- Replace 330uf capacitor with through hole.
- The opamp measuring the rear voltage needs a gnd reference to the rear battery

## XTend Daughterboard
<a name="36916"></span>
### Version 1

#### Functional
- If barrel jack holes are not drilled, then v+ does not connect to vin

### Fixed
- Xtend footprint incorrect
- Df13 holes too small (should be .5 mm)
- Led footprint wrong
- If using barebones, increase ground plane clearance, for ease of soldering
- Barebones - barrel jack holes not drilled
- Inductor pads too close together (check that moving apart doesn't expose ground plane to pads, maybe only an outward widening of pads is required) #note, these are actually perfect, they just are meant to reflow. i widened the pads to enable hand-soldering

------------- 
<a name="97692"></span>
### Version 2

#### Potential changes 
- Use right angle header for mcu connection: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/90136-2205/wm8206-nd/415812z

#### Issues 
- U4 (comparitor) completely wrong form factor [n/a]
- Increase size of 5vsw vias [n/a]
- Add clear label to px connector
- Pour ground plane

### Fixed  
- Barrel jack footprint wrong
- Label c1 orientation
- Add orientation lines to c2 and d4
- Change c1 orientation
- Fix current monitor
- Extend gnd plane under

### Version 3

#### Silkscreen 

#### Connectors 
- Switch to df13's that can solder to the board (e.g. the ones the pixhawk uses)

#### Functional 

#### Documentation 
- Molex connector pinout needs to be fixed on internal documentation (they are currently reversed)

### Fixed 
- Max voltage input is actually 16v (limited by the barrel jack)
- Dot for u1
- Di pin was not routed to the molex connector
- C1 c2 labels need to rotate -90
- Many "0 width" labels got printed and should be removed (test points, mounting holes)
- Label mcu pin 1

#### # denied #
- Add temperature sensor under the xtend? [no, because there is no uc on the ebox version, and we don't care about the temp of the xtend on the ground station]

------------- 
<a name="6946"></span>
### Version 4

#### Functional 
- Oscillator pads were tented (ordered from df robot)

#### Silkscreen 
- Tx/rx pairs are backwards. this is down to the label on the schemaitc, and therefore is backwards on the board
